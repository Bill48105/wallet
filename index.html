        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>To get started with Wallet you need to be registered &amp; logged
          into whatever platform you are accessing the bot on.&nbsp; For example
          on Freenode IRC ensure that you have registered and identified with
          NickServ on Freenode. You can register using the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>/msg NickServ REGISTER &lt;password&gt; &lt;email-address&gt;</code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>Once registered &amp; logged in, you are ready to go. There's no need
          to create an account with Wallet. You can increase your account
          balance in two ways; receiving coins through faucet/tips/soaks/games,
          or through depositing directly from a wallet or exchange. (See deposit
          command)</p>
        <!-- END INTRO -->
        <!-- START COINS -->
        <h2>Coins</h2>
        <p>To view all the coins that Wallet current supports use the following
          command:</p>
        <pre><code>.coins list<br>&lt;Wallet&gt; Bill48105: Supported coins: BTC CORG DOGE DOGET GRLC LDOGE LTC MNC PIGGY ROGER SOON SYS VTC XMR XVG XZC  - Usage: .ltc balance -or- .balance $LTC<br><br>NOTE: The default trigger prefix is . (dot) but it might vary depending<br>on how you access Wallet. For example if the prefix is ! you'd use:<br>!coins list<br>Or on reddit you just mention the bot:<br>/u/walletbot coins list</code></pre>
        <p>Since Wallet supports multiple coins, there is a global default coin
          of DOGE and each channel has ability to set their own default coin as
          well.&nbsp; But you can always choose an available coin when issuing
          commands:</p>

        <h2>Help</h2>
        <p>You can get a list of available commands issuing the help command:</p>

        <!-- START DEPOSIT -->
        <h2>Deposit</h2>
        <p>To deposit into your account use the following commands to receive
          your deposit addresses:</p>
        <pre><code>.deposit<br>.btc deposit<br>reddit:<br>/u/walletbot deposit $ltc</code></pre>
        <!-- END DEPOSIT -->
        <!-- START WITHDRAW -->
        <h2>Withdraw</h2>
        <p>To withdraw coins from your account use the following commands:
          (Minimum &amp; fee vary by coin)</p>
        <pre><code>.withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt;<br>.ltc withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt;<br>.xmr withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt;<br>reddit:<br>u/walletbot withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt; $DOGE</code></pre>
        <!-- END WITHDRAW -->
        <!-- START BALANCES -->
        <h2>Balances</h2>
        <p>To see how many coins are in your account use the following commands:</p>
        <pre><code>.balances<br>.roger balance<br>.bal $ROGER</code></pre>
        <!-- END BALANCES -->
        <!-- START SOAK -->
        <h2>Soak</h2>
        <p>A soak allows a user to choose a specific amount of coins to be
          distributed evenly among the recently active users within a channel. </p>
        <p>Example: When there are 10 active users in a channel and a user
          decides to soak 100 coins each active user will receive 10 coins each.
        </p>
        <p>To soak use the command: (&lt;minutes&gt; is optional - Default is
          try to get last 10 users)</p>
        <pre><code>.soak &lt;amount&gt; &lt;minutes&gt;<br>.ltc soak $0.10 (Soaks 10 cents worth of ltc)<br>.soak 100 $ROGER 1440 (Soaks 100 ROGER to all people active in last 24 hours)</code></pre>
        <!-- END SOAK -->
        <!-- START WALKTHROUGH -->
        <h2>Soak walkthrough</h2>
        <p>This walkthrough will show and explain what happens when a soak
          occurs in the channel. Often times new users are confused about what
          the response from Wallet means after a soak so this walkthrough aims
          to breakdown the response and explain each part thoroughly. </p>
        <p>A user soaks 10 DOGE (default coin) in the channel as so.</p>
        <pre><code>.soak 5</code></pre>
        <p>Wallet then outputs something that looks like the following:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;Wallet&gt; user1 soaked 0.5 DOGE each: 10 users [abcdef]</code></pre>
        <!-- START BREAKDOWN -->
        <h3>Breakdown of the response</h3>
        <p>Wallet will first split the soak evenly between all active users, 50
          in this case so each user will receive 0.2 coins each. </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;Wallet&gt; user1 soaked 50 with 0.2 DOGE each</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Scraps &amp; Community funded @bonuspot<br>
          </strong></p>
        <p>Any left over coins that cannot be divided as whole coins will go to
          the community @bonuspot as scraps, 0 coins in this case. Scraps go to
          @bonuspot balance and are used to fund community features such as
          faucet, confetti ducks, games, etc. </p>
        <p><strong>Soaked users</strong></p>
        <p>The last part of the syntax is the users who are included in the
          soak, these are users who are active in the channel either by talking
          within the last X minutes. This allows users to be notified when they
          are included in soaks.</p>
        <pre><code>user2 user2 user3 user4 user5</code></pre>
        <p>If the list is to large the bot will only display a random subset
          &amp; a code that you can use whogot command to lookup who was
          included</p>
        <pre><code>user2 user2 user3 user4 user5  (+15 more) [abcde]<br>.whogot abcde<br>&lt;wallet&gt; user1 -&gt; user15 + 17 others.</code></pre>
        <!-- END BREAKDOWN -->
        <!-- END WALKTHROUGH -->
        <!-- START RESERVE -->
        <h2>Reserve</h2>
        <p>Reserves are secondary balances separate from the one used for
          tipping and soaking.&nbsp; Your reserve can be useful to put away
          coins that are not show in your balance by default (privacy when doing
          balance in channel) or since coins can -only- be used with 'release'
          command, helps prevent accidental use like .soak all etc</p>
        <p><strong>Balances</strong></p>
        <pre><code>.balance reserve<br>&lt;wallet&gt; Bill48105: Your reserve balance is 117 DOGE<br>.ltc balance reserve<br>.balance reserve $roger</code></pre>

        <!-- START 2FA -->
        <p><strong>2 Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></p>
        <p>2FA is an optional yet recommended piece of security offered to
          users.&nbsp; <br>
          2FA runs in 1 of 4 modes that can be set on a per-user basis:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disabled</li>
          <li>Classic (release from reserve only)</li>
          <li>Default (any command that moves coins)</li>
          <li>Full (ALL commands except unlock, ping &amp; help)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>WARNING! Only run set in PRIVATE! (PM/DM/messages etc)</strong><br>
          While you can run confirm in a channel it's best to do in private as

            2FA app (NOT YOUR SECRET) to activate 2FA.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Unlocking 2FA</strong></p>
        <p>To unlock 2FA to release coins from your reserve you must use the
          following command: (Your reserves will remain open for 120 seconds or
          the number of seconds specified. 0 unlocks for 1 day)</p>
        <pre><code>.unlock &lt;2FA code (6 digit no spaces)&gt; &lt;seconds&gt;</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Locking immediately<br>
          </strong></p>
        <p>The bot auto locks after the specified time but you can force a lock:</p>
        <pre><code>.lock</code></pre>

        <p><br>
          <!-- END MISC --> </p>
        <!-- START DORMANCY -->
        <h2>Maintaining Account &amp; Dormancy Policy</h2>
        <p>The bot does not require creation of an account or logging in because
          it relies on the authentication of each platform and then uses the
          services of that platform to ensure you are logged in and account you
          are logged in as. This is convenient but also poses some security
          risks for each user to consider: </p>
        <pre><code>IT IS <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong> ALL USERS SETUP &amp; USE 2FA ON THE BOT!</code></pre>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>If your user account on that platform is hacked or compromised,
            whoever logs in as you will be seen as you for bot use, including
            having access to your balances.</li>
          <li>If you lose access to your user account on a given platform, you
            will&nbsp; lose access to that account on the bot, including access
            to your balances.</li>
          <li>If a platform suspends, locks, or deletes your user account, you
            will lost access to that account on the bot, including access to
            your balances.</li>
          <li>If a platform allows users to register previously used accounts,
            the bot will use that account for bot access including potentially
            accessing the balances of a previous user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So what does all of that mean? Your bot account is only as secure as
          the account you login as on any given platform..&nbsp; You should
          protect your accounts with best-practice strong passwords (never
          re-used!), and utilize advanced security features such as 2FA if they
          offer it. But in addition it's highly recommended that you setup &amp;
          enable TOTP 2FA on the bot too! Why? Not all platforms offer or
          support 2FA but that 2FA only protects login to that account and DOES
          NOT protect against account re-use abuse or or other attacks on your
          bot account since once someone is logged into a given platform, the
          bot assumes that user also has access to your bot account.</p>
        <p>To help mitigate these attacks and help keep your bot account safe
          the bot has the following dormancy &amp; recovery policy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bot accounts of users without 2FA enabled not accessed for 90 days
            will be auto locked.</li>
          <li>Bot accounts of users with 2FA enabled not accessed for 6 months
            will be auto locked.</li>
          <li>All bot accounts of users not accessed for 1 year will be
            automatically purged as dormant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accounts <u>may</u> be unlocked or recovered from dormancy,
          depending on the status of your platform account. The factors vary by
          platform but include such things as the age (date of registration),
          but mostly if you can provide reasonable proof that a bot account is
          yours. <strong>Since the bot does not collect personal information
            from users, the best way to do that is having had setup 2FA on the
            bot BEFORE the lock or dormancy happens..&nbsp;</strong> </p>

        <p>Let's explain..&nbsp; When you deposit coins into the bot, when
          someone tips you coins on the bot, all user balances on the bot are
          "off chain". Meaning they are tracked outside of the normal wallet
          chain allowing for instant transfers without fees. For that
          convenience you're putting your trust in whoever holds your coins
          while "off chain", including the understanding that while reasonable
          effort to track and protect your balances, and reasonable effort to
          provide use of the bot including withdrawal of your balance to an
          address on the chain (your own wallet, exchange etc), <strong>there
            is no guarantee against loss no matter the cause.</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>So what are best practices for wallets, online wallets, or
              bots?</u></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diversify your balances between wallets you hold &amp; online
            services/bots.</li>
          <li>Hardware wallets are safest. Official wallets next. Phone wallets
            are risky.</li>
          <li>Keep balances in online services/bots at minimum needed for use</li>
          <li>Assess the risk of ANY wallet. Even your own wallet has risks.
            BACKUP!</li>
          <li>Keep your keys/passphrases private and stored safely. BACKUP!</li>
          <li>Yes backing up is THAT important when managing your own wallet.</li>
        </ul>
