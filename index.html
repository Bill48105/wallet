        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>To get started with Wallet you need to be registered &amp; logged
          into whatever platform you are accessing the bot on.&nbsp; For example
          on Freenode IRC ensure that you have registered and identified with
          NickServ on Freenode. You can register using the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>/msg NickServ REGISTER &lt;password&gt; &lt;email-address&gt;</code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>Once registered &amp; logged in, you are ready to go. There's no need
          to create an account with Wallet. You can increase your account
          balance in two ways; receiving coins through faucet/tips/soaks/games,
          or through depositing directly from a wallet or exchange. (See deposit
          command)</p>
        <!-- END INTRO -->
        <!-- START COINS -->
        <h2>Coins</h2>
        <p>To view all the coins that Wallet current supports use the following
          command:</p>
        <pre><code>.coins list<br>&lt;Wallet&gt; Bill48105: Supported coins: BTC CORG DOGE DOGET GRLC LDOGE LTC MNC PIGGY ROGER SOON SYS VTC XMR XVG XZC  - Usage: .ltc balance -or- .balance $LTC<br><br>NOTE: The default trigger prefix is . (dot) but it might vary depending<br>on how you access Wallet. For example if the prefix is ! you'd use:<br>!coins list<br>Or on reddit you just mention the bot:<br>/u/walletbot coins list</code></pre>
        <p>Since Wallet supports multiple coins, there is a global default coin
          of DOGE and each channel has ability to set their own default coin as
          well.&nbsp; But you can always choose an available coin when issuing
          commands:</p>

        <h2>Help</h2>
        <p>You can get a list of available commands issuing the help command:</p>

        <!-- END BONUSTIME -->
        <!-- START DEPOSIT -->
        <h2>Deposit</h2>
        <p>To deposit into your account use the following commands to receive
          your deposit addresses:</p>
        <pre><code>.deposit<br>.btc deposit<br>reddit:<br>/u/walletbot deposit $ltc</code></pre>
        <!-- END DEPOSIT -->
        <!-- START WITHDRAW -->
        <h2>Withdraw</h2>
        <p>To withdraw coins from your account use the following commands:
          (Minimum &amp; fee vary by coin)</p>
        <pre><code>.withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt;<br>.ltc withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt;<br>.xmr withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt;<br>reddit:<br>u/walletbot withdraw &lt;address&gt; &lt;amount|all&gt; $DOGE</code></pre>
        <!-- END WITHDRAW -->
        <!-- START BALANCES -->
        <h2>Balances</h2>
        <p>To see how many coins are in your account use the following commands:</p>
        <pre><code>.balances<br>.roger balance<br>.bal $ROGER</code></pre>
        <!-- END BALANCES -->
        <!-- START SOAK -->
        <h2>Soak</h2>
        <p>A soak allows a user to choose a specific amount of coins to be
          distributed evenly among the recently active users within a channel. </p>
        <p>Example: When there are 10 active users in a channel and a user
          decides to soak 100 coins each active user will receive 10 coins each.
        </p>
        <p>To soak use the command: (&lt;minutes&gt; is optional - Default is
          try to get last 10 users)</p>
        <pre><code>.soak &lt;amount&gt; &lt;minutes&gt;<br>.ltc soak $0.10 (Soaks 10 cents worth of ltc)<br>.soak 100 $ROGER 1440 (Soaks 100 ROGER to all people active in last 24 hours)</code></pre>
        <!-- END SOAK -->
        <!-- START WALKTHROUGH -->
        <h2>Soak walkthrough</h2>
        <p>This walkthrough will show and explain what happens when a soak
          occurs in the channel. Often times new users are confused about what
          the response from Wallet means after a soak so this walkthrough aims
          to breakdown the response and explain each part thoroughly. </p>
        <p>A user soaks 10 DOGE (default coin) in the channel as so.</p>
        <pre><code>.soak 5</code></pre>
        <p>Wallet then outputs something that looks like the following:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;Wallet&gt; user1 soaked 0.5 DOGE each: 10 users [abcdef]</code></pre>
        <!-- START BREAKDOWN -->
        <h3>Breakdown of the response</h3>
        <p>Wallet will first split the soak evenly between all active users, 50
          in this case so each user will receive 0.2 coins each. </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;Wallet&gt; user1 soaked 50 with 0.2 DOGE each</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Scraps &amp; Community funded @bonuspot<br>
          </strong></p>
        <p>Any left over coins that cannot be divided as whole coins will go to
          the community @bonuspot as scraps, 0 coins in this case. Scraps go to
          @bonuspot balance and are used to fund community features such as
          faucet, confetti ducks, games, etc. </p>
        <p><strong>Soaked users</strong></p>
        <p>The last part of the syntax is the users who are included in the
          soak, these are users who are active in the channel either by talking
          within the last X minutes. This allows users to be notified when they
          are included in soaks.</p>
        <pre><code>user2 user2 user3 user4 user5</code></pre>
        <p>If the list is to large the bot will only display a random subset
          &amp; a code that you can use whogot command to lookup who was
          included</p>
        <pre><code>user2 user2 user3 user4 user5  (+15 more) [abcde]<br>.whogot abcde<br>&lt;wallet&gt; user1 -&gt; user15 + 17 others.</code></pre>
        <!-- END BREAKDOWN -->
        <!-- END WALKTHROUGH -->
        <!-- START RESERVE -->
        <h2>Reserve</h2>
        <p>Reserves are secondary balances separate from the one used for
          tipping and soaking.&nbsp; Your reserve can be useful to put away
          coins that are not show in your balance by default (privacy when doing
          balance in channel) or since coins can -only- be used with 'release'
          command, helps prevent accidental use like .soak all etc</p>
        <p><strong>Balances</strong></p>
        <pre><code>.balance reserve<br>&lt;wallet&gt; Bill48105: Your reserve balance is 117 DOGE<br>.ltc balance reserve<br>.balance reserve $roger</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Adding to Reserve</strong></p>
        <pre><code>.reserve &lt;amount&gt;<br>.btc reserve 0.0001<br>.reserve 0.001 $LTC</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Releasing from Reserve</strong></p>

        <!-- START 2FA -->
        <p><strong>2 Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></p>
        <p>2FA is an optional yet recommended piece of security offered to
          users.&nbsp; <br>
          2FA runs in 1 of 4 modes that can be set on a per-user basis:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disabled</li>
          <li>Classic (release from reserve only)</li>
          <li>Default (any command that moves coins)</li>
          <li>Full (ALL commands except unlock, ping &amp; help)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>WARNING! Only run set in PRIVATE! (PM/DM/messages etc)</strong><br>
          While you can run confirm in a channel it's best to do in private as
          well</p>

            2FA app (NOT YOUR SECRET) to activate 2FA.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Unlocking 2FA</strong></p>
        <p>To unlock 2FA to release coins from your reserve you must use the
          following command: (Your reserves will remain open for 120 seconds or
          the number of seconds specified. 0 unlocks for 1 day)</p>
        <pre><code>.unlock &lt;2FA code (6 digit no spaces)&gt; &lt;seconds&gt;</code></pre>
        <p><strong>Locking immediately<br>
          </strong></p>
        <p>The bot auto locks after the specified time but you can force a lock:</p>
        <pre><code>.lock</code></pre>
        <!-- END 2FA -->
        <!-- START RAIN -->

          various groups by type.</p>
        <p><br>
          <!-- END MISC --> </p>
        <!-- START DORMANCY -->
        <h2>Maintaining Account &amp; Dormancy Policy</h2>
        <p>The bot does not require creation of an account or logging in because
          it relies on the authentication of each platform and then uses the
          services of that platform to ensure you are logged in and account you
          are logged in as. This is convenient but also poses some security
          risks for each user to consider: </p>
        <pre><code>IT IS <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong> ALL USERS SETUP &amp; USE 2FA ON THE BOT!</code></pre>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>If your user account on that platform is hacked or compromised,
            whoever logs in as you will be seen as you for bot use, including
            having access to your balances.</li>
          <li>If you lose access to your user account on a given platform, you
            will&nbsp; lose access to that account on the bot, including access
            to your balances.</li>
          <li>If a platform suspends, locks, or deletes your user account, you
            will lost access to that account on the bot, including access to
            your balances.</li>
          <li>If a platform allows users to register previously used accounts,
            the bot will use that account for bot access including potentially
            accessing the balances of a previous user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So what does all of that mean? Your bot account is only as secure as
          the account you login as on any given platform..&nbsp; You should
          protect your accounts with best-practice strong passwords (never
          re-used!), and utilize advanced security features such as 2FA if they
          offer it. But in addition it's highly recommended that you setup &amp;
          enable TOTP 2FA on the bot too! Why? Not all platforms offer or
          support 2FA but that 2FA only protects login to that account and DOES
          NOT protect against account re-use abuse or or other attacks on your
          bot account since once someone is logged into a given platform, the
          bot assumes that user also has access to your bot account.</p>
        <p>To help mitigate these attacks and help keep your bot account safe
          the bot has the following dormancy &amp; recovery policy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bot accounts of users without 2FA enabled not accessed for 90 days
            will be auto locked.</li>
          <li>Bot accounts of users with 2FA enabled not accessed for 6 months
            will be auto locked.</li>
          <li>All bot accounts of users not accessed for 1 year will be
            automatically purged as dormant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accounts <u>may</u> be unlocked or recovered from dormancy,
          depending on the status of your platform account. The factors vary by
          platform but include such things as the age (date of registration),
          but mostly if you can provide reasonable proof that a bot account is
          yours. <strong>Since the bot does not collect personal information
            from users, the best way to do that is having had setup 2FA on the

        <h2>"Are they MY coins when they're on the bot?"</h2>
        <p>Well not really.. Why not?:</p>
        <pre><code>The holder of the wallet &amp; keys is in control of the coins.<br>In short: If they're not in your wallet, they're not technically yours..</code></pre>
        <p>"Wait what?!"<br>
          Put another way:<br>
        </p>
        <pre><code>Never store coins outside your own control you are not willing to lose.<br>This is true of ANY online wallet or service, including bots.</code></pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>Let's explain..&nbsp; When you deposit coins into the bot, when
          someone tips you coins on the bot, all user balances on the bot are
          "off chain". Meaning they are tracked outside of the normal wallet
          chain allowing for instant transfers without fees. For that
          convenience you're putting your trust in whoever holds your coins
          while "off chain", including the understanding that while reasonable
          effort to track and protect your balances, and reasonable effort to
          provide use of the bot including withdrawal of your balance to an
          address on the chain (your own wallet, exchange etc), <strong>there
            is no guarantee against loss no matter the cause.</strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong><u>So what are best practices for wallets, online wallets, or
              bots?</u></strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diversify your balances between wallets you hold &amp; online
            services/bots.</li>
          <li>Hardware wallets are safest. Official wallets next. Phone wallets
            are risky.</li>
          <li>Keep balances in online services/bots at minimum needed for use</li>
          <li>Assess the risk of ANY wallet. Even your own wallet has risks.
            BACKUP!</li>
          <li>Keep your keys/passphrases private and stored safely. BACKUP!</li>
          <li>Yes backing up is THAT important when managing your own wallet.</li>

        <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>"Are my coins really worth $5?"</strong> - The bot uses
            market data from multiple exchanges &amp; aggregate sources to <strong>ESTIMATE</strong>
            what your coins <em>MIGHT</em> be worth. So the short answer is
            maybe. The longer answer is more complicated. Basically things are
            worth what someone will give you for it at a given point in time, be
            it manure or cryptocurrency. No the bot is not offering you that,
            nor it is guaranteeing you could get that. Because what you might
            get depends on many factors from transfer/trade fees to the market
            at any given moment, which market pair you traded with, among other
            things.</li>
          <li><strong>"Why does xtip warn me about value?"</strong> - When you
            create a person to person cross-tip swap with xtip, the bot uses
            current market data to <strong>ESTIMATE</strong> what the coins you
            use are worth to calculate <strong>APPROXIMATION</strong> of how
            many of the coins you want. Since the value (as in what people are
            offering, asking or actually traded for) of coins can vary between
            exchanges, the bot uses the average of the most recent data which
            normally is normally minimal effect for common popular coins with
            plenty of volume &amp; arbitrage to keep gaps between markets
            narrow. But for some coins the gaps can be HUGE, resulting in
            confusion of value &amp; resulting in the bot alerting you to
            discrepancies during xtip. The notice is not meant as an error but
            rather a "heads up" that you might get more (or less) using a
            different path from coin1 to coin2. (Say going to BTC or LTC first
            then to coin2 vs directly) It's up to you if you are concerned with
            the potential gap the bot is alerting you to. </li>
          <li><strong>"What's this about market gaps then?"</strong> - The
            simplest example is say you wanted to buy or sell BTC, if you go to
            5 exchanges you'll see each one has a different price. In fact some
            people take advantage of this and buy on 1 cheaper exchange and sell
            on another higher priced one for a profit, aka arbitrage trading.
            But realize these gaps happen within any given exchange too, between
            market PAIRS. DOGE for example might be traded in USD, BTC, LTC
            &amp; others. The price is given in that pair's base coin/fiat so to
            buy/sell DOGE on BTC it's BTC, on LTC it's LTC etc. Because those
            markets are independent of each other their prices fluctuate to the
            point there ends up a gap in the USD value of each. When a coin has
            a BTC pair with 1 satoshi floor where there's no sub-satoshi
            option,&nbsp; it's often the case where the market gap for some
            coins is HUGE.</li>
          <li><strong>"How does the bot estimate the USD/$ value of coins then?"</strong>
            - The bot uses available market data from multiple sources. Where a
            USD pair exists for a coin, the data from multiple sources is
            averaged &amp; used. Otherwise a coin that does, such as BTC, must
            be used as an intermediary path to get to USD. Why? Because that's
            how a person would normally do it.. If you had DOGE and no USD pair
            existed you'd would trade your DOGE for BTC then trade your BTC for
            USD. So doing that to estimate value is logical. The caveat is that
            which coin you use as intermediary can make a huge difference in the
            net result.. Market gaps (value of a coin on 1 market vs another)
            come into play but specifically the "satoshi floor" effect can
            REALLY make for huge discrepancies.</li>
          <li><strong>"Wait, what 'satoshi floor' effect?"</strong> - Since BTC
            has historically been the most common trading pair most every coin
            is traded in it. Bitcoin units go down to 1 satoshi, or 0.00000001
            BTC worth, but some coins are worth less than 1 satoshi based on the
            current price on other markets. Say a coin is worth 0.001 DOGE
            (1/1000th) and DOGE is worth 0.00000100 BTC (1/1,000,00th). So that
            coin is worth 1/10th less than 1 satoshi, the lowest fraction of
            Bitcoin. Some exchanges support sub-sat markets so the satoshi floor
            effect doesn't happen. But for exchanges that honor 8 places, it can
            cause HUGE market gaps since a coin will be worth 1 satoshi on BTC
            pair but 1/10th of a satoshi on another, with millions of sell
            orders at 1 sat that go unfilled, while there's volume on the other
            market being more common. Some argue the market with highest trading
            volume is the actual value, while others claim the BTC value is
            since the market exists with orders &amp; BTC is traditionally the
            "de facto" market.</li>

        <h2>December 2021</h2>
        Big changes at Discord regarding bots.. Here's a few links you can read
        about it but basically a lot is up in the air at this point as far as
        all bots including Wallet and if they'll still work at all depending on
        what library is used, if functionality from commands to bridging to
        moderation tools will still work, if bots will be approved in time or
        which bots Discord feels has proven an actual need for message intents,
        etc.&nbsp; The intention is to keep Wallet available on Discord and
        retain all functionality but that may not be possible. More will be
        known the closer we get to the deadline but in the meantime please refer
        to the Best Practices section of the bot docs.<br>
        <span style="color: red;"> <strong>(It's highly recommended you have

        <h2 id="freenode-update">** IMPORTANT FREENODE UPDATE ** </h2>
        <h2>June 2021</h2>
        Wallet bot had continuously been on freenode for over 6 years with
        1000's of users in dozens of channels. Unfortunately in June 2021
        freenode staff migrated to new IRC software with little notice, wiping
        all user &amp; channel registrations in the process. Since Wallet bot
        relies on the underlying platform to verify users are logged in and
        which account they are logged in with, doing so essentially wiped all
        user freenode balances as Wallet is no longer able to verify those users
        &amp; link them to the correct bot account. So Wallet was immediately
        shutdown on freenode to protect user bot balances from being accessed by
        others. If there is enough demand, Wallet may be re-launched on freenode
        at a future time. In the meantime former freenode users can access &amp;
        use Wallet &amp; all Wallet features they've grown to love on one of the
        following platforms:<br>
        <br>
        <code>&lt;Wallet&gt; Bill48105: Status: • discord: On • libera: On •
          telegram: On • keybase: On • matrix: On • reddit: On • slack: On •
          hmail: On • rizon: On • oftc: On • twitch: On • freenode: Off </code><br>
        <u><strong><br>
            "WHAT ABOUT MY COINS?!"</strong></u><br>
        Efforts have been underway to manually verify users &amp; migrate
        balances to one of the other platforms. Users who had 2FA enabled on
        their freenode account on Wallet are getting priority migration as that
        makes the process more reliable &amp; simpler. (Another reason to get
        2FA enabled ASAP on ALL platforms for situations such as this..)&nbsp;
        For those who did not, the process is more time-consuming &amp; arduous
        but they're being worked thru as well. In either case, reach out to
        Bill48105 on one of the available platforms. <br>
        <span style="color: red;"><u><strong>WARNING: DO NOT SHARE PERSONAL INFO
              WITH ANYONE!</strong></u> </span><br>
        Especially not your 2FA secret, freenode password, to be sent coins to
        recover, etc! You will NOT be asked for those things, even by
        "Bill48105" or anyone else related to Wallet. Be sure you verify you are
        speaking with the ACTUAL Bill48105 in one of the official coin or bot
        channels and do not assume you are.<br>
