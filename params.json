{"name":"Dogewallet.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"<h1>Getting started</h1><br>\r\nTo get started with DogeWallet you need to ensure that you have registered and identified with NickServ on Freenode. You can register using the following command:<br>\r\n    `/msg NickServ REGISTER <password> <email-address>`\r\n<br>\r\nOnce registered and identified with NickServ you are ready to go, there's no need to create an account with DogeWallet. You can increase your account balance in two ways; receiving coins through tips, soaks and rain or through depositing directly from a wallet.<p>\r\n<h1>Idle time (bonus time)</h1><br>\r\nDogeWallet uses the concept of idle time which allows a user to still be included in soaks for up to 24 hours without needing to talk in the channel every 10 minutes to remain active. Whilst a user will still remain active for 10 minutes after talking it is possible to earn much greater amounts of idle time by soaking and raining. Idle time also allows you to remain active even if you are offline, meaning that you will still be included in soaks even if you disconnect from IRC completely. This significantly cuts down on the amount of spam generated in the channel whilst also rewards those who give back to the channel by soaking and raining. <p>\r\n<h1>Deposit</h1><br>\r\nTo deposit into your account use the following command to receive your deposit address:\r\n`/msg DogeWallet deposit`<p> \r\n<h1>Withdraw</h1><br>\r\nTo withdraw coins from your account use the following command:\r\n`/msg DogeWallet withdraw <wallet address> <amount>`<p>\r\nBalance\r\nTo see how many coins are in your account use the following command:\r\n`/msg DogeWallet balance`\r\nSoak\r\nA soak allows a user to choose a specific amount of coins to be distributed evenly among the active users within a channel. Soaks can either be public where the channel can see who soaked the coins or ninja where the soaker is not announced to the channel.\r\nExample: When there are 10 active users in a channel and a user decides to soak 1000 coins each active user will receive 100 coins each. \r\nTo public soak use the command:\r\n`.soak <amount>`\r\nTo ninja soak use the following command to send a message directly to the bot:\r\n`/msg DogeWallet soak <amount>`\r\nSoak walkthrough\r\nThis walkthrough will show and explain what happens when a soak occurs in the channel. Often times new users are confused about what the response from DogeWallet means after a soak so this walkthrough aims to breakdown the response and explain each part thoroughly. \r\nA user soaks 500 coins in the channel as so.\r\n`.soak 500`\r\nDogeWallet then outputs something that looks like the following:\r\n`<+DogeWallet> user1 in #channel soaked 12 with 41 each + 8.0 Scraps = 500.0 \r\n- Idle bonus: 63x = 525.0 -> 625 min  Chan Soaks: 28472.0 user2 user3 user4\r\nuser5 user6 user7 user8 user9 user10 user11 user12 user13`\r\nBreakdown of the response\r\nDogeWallet will first split the soak evenly between all active users, 12 in this case so each user will receive 41 coins each. \r\nuser1 in #channel soaked 12 with 41 each\r\nScraps\r\nAny left over coins that cannot be divided as whole coins will go to the bot as scraps, 8 coins in this case. Scraps go to the DogeWallet channel balance and are used to fund bonus soaks whilst also helping to pay for server costs which keep the bot running. \r\nuser1 in #channel soaked 12 with 41 each + 8.0 Scraps = 500.0 \r\n<h1>Idle bonus</h1>\r\nThe idle bonus is a randomly multiplier that assigns you an amount of idle time that roughly correlates to the amount of coins that you soaked, depending on luck you may receive more or less than what you soaked. In this case the user received 525 minutes of idle time for their soak which when added onto their already banked time brought them up to 625 minutes total.\r\n- Idle bonus: 63x = 525.0 -> 625 min  \r\nChan soaks\r\nChan soaks is the amount of coins that the channel as a whole have soaked since the last bonus soak was triggered, the greater this value is the more likely another soak will trigger a bonus soak. In this example the total channel soaks was  28472 coins.\r\nChan Soaks: 28472.0\r\nSoaked users\r\nThe last part of the syntax is the users who are included in the soak, these are users who are active in the channel either by talking within the last 10 minutes or by having idle time. This allows users to be notified when they are included in soaks.\r\nuser2 user3 user4 user5 user6 user7 user8 user9 user10 user11 user12 user13\r\nBonus soaks\r\nA bonus soak is a soak that is triggered randomly after a soak has just occurred in the channel. It is funded by the accumulation of scraps from previous soaks and is more likely to trigger as the 'chan soaks' (total number of coins soaked since last bonus soak) increases.\r\n`<+DogeWallet> *** BONUS TRIGGERED by user1!!! DogeWallet in #channel is soaking \r\n44 shibes with 83 each. Total: 3652 of 3653 possible.`\r\nRain\r\nRain allows a user to give each active member in the channel a specific amount of coins. Rain can either be public where the channel can see who rained the coins or ninja where the user raining is not announced to the channel.\r\nExample: When there are 10 active users in a channel and a user decides to rain 10 coins each active user will receive 10 coins each.\r\nTo public rain use the command:\r\n`.rain <amount>`\r\nTo ninja rain use the following command to send a message directly to the bot:\r\n`/msg DogeWallet rain <amount>`\r\nTip\r\nYou can send another user a tip using the following command:\r\n`.tip <user>  <amount>`\r\nJackpot\r\nThe jackpot command allows users a chance of triggering one of the following actions:\r\nThe jackpot balance is tipped back to the user contributing to the jackpot.\r\nThe jackpot balance is tipped to a different user in the channel.\r\nThe jackpot balance is soaked to the entire channel.\r\nTo contribute to the jackpot and be in with a chance of triggering the jackpot use the following command:\r\n`.jackpot <amount>`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
